# About Craig's Deno Diary

Welcome to my blog! I'll be blogging about the JavaScript and TypeScript runtime
[Deno](https://deno.land). This blog will be published periodically as my free time allows.

I'm hoping to evolve the blog with new features and improved code quality as
time goes on. Source code can be found in this repo:
[https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-blog](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-blog).

If you are interested in receiving updates on new blog posts, please follow my [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@deno_diary) feed. Also, DM me at cdoremus#4874 on Discord if you have any suggestions and ideas for this blog. I look forward to hearing from you.
